# Landing-Page
<p><h2><strong>About "Landing Page" Project</strong></h2>
This webpage is styled based on a particular product design demo to practice my CSS skills; yet to implement media query responsiveness.
This website that I created has four main sections (and a footer).
This project is purely created from HTML and CSS only.
The project prototype is as shown below
